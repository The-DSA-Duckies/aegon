# aegon

aegon is Guppie Grader's frontend repository for The DSA Duckies' Senior Project. You can visit our deployed project at https://guppiegrader.xyz, but you **must** be a University of Florida (UF) Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Teaching Assistant (TA) to access the majority of our project.

We are using Node version 18.19.0 and managing my versions with Node Version Manager (NVM). Here is a link to set that up:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font. We also use [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) for user authentication and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) for deployment.

## Getting Started Locally

First, install any required packages and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once the terminal says our project is ready, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the home page of Guppie Grader. Pages will auto-update as you edit the file.

## I'm a current UF DSA TA and I want to continue developing this! 

We're glad to hear this! You should get into contact with Professor Aman about allocating hours towards developing this project. You will also want to reach out to one of The DSA Duckies that originally completed this Senior Project. Here is one of our contacts: Kevin Allen (kevinj.allen2020@gmail.com). We should be able to help transfer over ownerships for future development.
